# implementing ML algorithms from scratch


## this is the great place to understand implementation of ML algorithms from scratch and using them on dataset.

This repository contains a collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch in Python. It serves as a learning resource for understanding the fundamental concepts behind these algorithms. 
Basically, we will implement one algorithm each day on this repositories and test algo on dataset, this will help beginners to get start with machine learning. I personally recommend to have basic knowledge Numpy, Pandas like python libraries.


## List of algorithms we have implemented :

- **Supervised Learning:**
  - [Linear Regression](./linear_regression.py)
